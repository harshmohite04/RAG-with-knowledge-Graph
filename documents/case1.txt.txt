Case Title: Sharma v. BrightWave Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  
Jurisdiction: Civil Court, Pune (Fictional)  
Matter: Wrongful Termination and Unpaid Bonuses

Background  
Ananya Sharma, age 29, worked as a Senior Software Engineer at BrightWave Technologies Pvt. Ltd., an AI product company based in Pune. She joined the company on 1 April 2022 under a written employment contract that promised a fixed salary plus a performance‑linked annual bonus of up to 20% of her CTC, subject to meeting mutually agreed KPIs.

In March 2024, BrightWave secured a major contract to build an AI‑powered document processing system for a chain of private hospitals. Sharma led the backend and ML integration team. The project was delivered on time, and the client signed a letter of appreciation citing “exceptional technical delivery and responsiveness” from Sharma’s team.

Events Leading to Dispute  
In April 2024, during annual performance reviews, Sharma’s manager verbally praised her work and told her she would receive “the full 20% bonus” for FY 2023–24. However, when salary revision letters were issued, her bonus line item showed “0” and her salary increment was significantly lower than her peers.

Sharma requested a written explanation from HR and her manager. After two weeks without a clear response, she escalated the matter to the CTO, attaching:  
- Email threads showing the manager’s praise and preliminary bonus discussions.  
- The client’s appreciation letter.  
- Internal performance dashboards where her team’s metrics exceeded targets.

Two weeks later, she received a show‑cause notice alleging:  
1) Failure to follow internal coding standards.  
2) Unauthorized use of third‑party open‑source libraries.  
3) “Unprofessional tone” in emails when escalating concerns about her bonus.

Sharma submitted a written response within the deadline, refuting each allegation:  
- She attached code review logs where her work had been approved by senior engineers.  
- She pointed to the company’s internal policy permitting open‑source use with proper licenses.  
- She provided her email threads, which were firm but not abusive, and argued that escalation of a compensation dispute was her right.

Despite this, on 10 June 2024, BrightWave terminated Sharma with immediate effect, citing “gross misconduct” and stating that no bonus was payable and no notice period salary would be given.

Plaintiff’s Position (Sharma)  
Sharma files a civil suit for:  
- Declaration that her termination was illegal and void.  
- Recovery of:  
  - 20% annual bonus for FY 2023–24.  
  - Three months’ notice‑period salary as per contract.  
  - Compensation for mental harassment and reputational damage.  

Her core legal arguments:  
1) Contractual Breach:  
   - The written contract promises a performance bonus subject to KPIs.  
   - Internal performance metrics and client feedback demonstrate she met or exceeded those KPIs.  
   - The employer has not produced any written KPI evaluation justifying a zero bonus.

2) Lack of Due Process:  
   - The company issued a show‑cause notice but did not conduct a fair inquiry or interview witnesses.  
   - No prior written warnings were issued to her at any time during her tenure.  
   - Termination was immediate and without pay in lieu of notice, contrary to the contract’s requirement of three months’ notice or salary in lieu.

3) Pretextual Misconduct Allegations:  
   - Misconduct was raised only after she insisted on her bonus and escalated to senior management.  
   - Code quality and library usage had consistently passed internal reviews, indicating the reasons were an after‑thought to justify a cost‑cutting decision.

4) Damage to Reputation:  
   - The termination letter uses the term “gross misconduct,” which can seriously damage her future employment prospects in the relatively small AI/tech community.

Defendant’s Position (BrightWave)  
BrightWave files a written statement denying all allegations and arguing:  
1) Managerial Discretion on Bonuses:  
   - The bonus clause is “discretionary,” and meeting KPIs does not create an automatic entitlement.  
   - The company faced financial stress in early 2024 and decided to restrict bonuses across several teams.

2) Policy Violations:  
   - Sharma allegedly introduced an open‑source library with a restrictive license into a core product without first routing it through the Legal and Compliance team.  
   - She allegedly merged code without following two‑reviewer approval policy.

3) Breakdown of Trust:  
   - Her emails to senior management are described as “threatening” and “disruptive,” undermining the working relationship with her manager.  
   - The company asserts that given the high‑trust nature of her role, the employment relationship became untenable.

4) Contractual Right to Terminate:  
   - The company claims the contract allows immediate termination for misconduct without notice or severance.

Key Evidence  
From Sharma:  
- Employment contract with bonus and notice‑period clauses.  
- Email exchanges showing bonus discussions, praise, and her escalation.  
- Client appreciation letter naming her as the project lead.  
- Code review logs and internal documentation showing approvals.  

From BrightWave:  
- HR policy documents regarding bonuses and conduct.  
- An internal “Incident Report” prepared after the bonus dispute began, listing alleged violations.  
- Selected extracts of email threads highlighting sharp language in Sharma’s escalation emails.  

Issues Before the Court  
1) Whether Sharma’s termination for “gross misconduct” complied with the principles of natural justice and the terms of her contract.  
2) Whether the bonus clause created an enforceable right in Sharma’s favor under the facts of this case.  
3) Whether BrightWave lawfully denied notice‑period salary by invoking misconduct.  
4) Whether Sharma is entitled to damages for reputational harm and, if so, to what extent.

Possible Legal Analysis (Outline)  
- The court will likely scrutinize whether a proper inquiry was held. Immediate termination without robust evidence or a documented process may weigh against the employer.  
- The wording of the bonus clause will be critical: if it is purely discretionary, Sharma may struggle to claim it as a right; if it is tied clearly to quantifiable KPIs, her strong performance evidence may support her claim.  
- If the court finds that misconduct was cited pretextually and primarily in retaliation for her raising a compensation dispute, it may treat the termination as wrongful and award notice‑period salary and possibly the bonus.  
- Large reputational damages are harder to quantify, but the use of “gross misconduct” in the termination letter without solid backing could justify some compensatory amount.

Sample “Prayer” (What the Plaintiff Asks For)  
In her plaint, Sharma could pray for:  
- A declaration that the termination letter dated 10 June 2024 is illegal and void.  
- Direction to BrightWave to pay:  
  - FY 2023–24 bonus at 20% of her CTC.  
  - Salary in lieu of three months’ notice.  
  - Additional compensatory damages (for example, a quantified lump sum) for mental agony and damage to reputation.  
- Costs of the suit and any other relief the court deems just and proper.
