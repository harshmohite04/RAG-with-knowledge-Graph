DUMMY LEGAL CASE – FAKE LAND DOCUMENTS (FOR STUDY PRACTICE ONLY)

1. BASIC FACTS

Complainant:  
Name: Mr. Rohan Patil  
Age: 35 years  
Address: Kothrud, Pune, Maharashtra  

Accused:  
Accused No.1 – Mr. Ajay Sharma  
Accused No.2 – Mr. Vijay Sharma  
Accused No.3 – Mr. Suresh Deshmukh (deed writer / middleman)  

Property:  
Agricultural land Gat No.145, admeasuring 1.5 Hectares, Village Gurudham, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune, recorded in the name of original owner Mrs. Savita Joshi.[1]

2. STORY / CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

(1) In January 2023, Accused No.1 Ajay approached the complainant Rohan and told him that he is the absolute owner of the above land. He showed photocopies of a 7/12 extract and a sale deed of 2018 allegedly executed in his favour by the original owner, Mrs. Savita Joshi.[1]

(2) Ajay said he urgently needed money and therefore was ready to sell the land at a discounted price of Rs. 90,00,000. He assured that the title was clear and that there was no dispute or encumbrance on the land.[1]

(3) Relying on these representations and documents, Rohan agreed to buy the land. On 10.02.2023, an Agreement to Sell was executed. Rohan paid Rs. 15,00,000 in cash and Rs. 25,00,000 by bank transfer as advance, total Rs. 40,00,000.[2]

(4) On 15.03.2023, a registered Sale Deed was executed at the Sub‑Registrar Office, Mulshi. Ajay signed as vendor and Rohan as purchaser. Accused No.3 Suresh prepared the document and arranged witnesses.[2]

(5) After registration, Rohan submitted an application for mutation of his name in revenue records. At the Talathi office, he was informed that the land is still recorded in the name of Mrs. Savita Joshi and that no prior sale deed in favour of Ajay is registered.[1]

(6) Rohan then met Mrs. Savita Joshi personally. She categorically denied selling the land to Ajay at any time and said that the signatures appearing on the alleged 2018 sale deed were not hers.[1]

(7) On verifying with the Sub‑Registrar records, it was found that the supposed 2018 sale deed is not found in the register and the registration number and seal on the copy are fake. This clearly shows that the earlier sale deed and supporting documents were forged.[1]

(8) Rohan realised that Ajay, with the help of Vijay and Suresh, had created forged documents and used them as genuine, thereby cheating him and dishonestly inducing him to part with Rs. 40,00,000.[3]

(9) Rohan has therefore filed (a) a criminal complaint for cheating and forgery; and (b) a civil suit for cancellation of the March 2023 sale deed and for recovery of his money with interest.[4]

3. POSSIBLE CRIMINAL OFFENCES (INDIA – IPC)

On these facts, the following sections of the Indian Penal Code may be attracted (for study / drafting reference):[5][6][3]

– Section 420 IPC – Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.  
– Section 463 / 467 IPC – Forgery of valuable security or document affecting valuable property (sale deed, title documents).[6]
– Section 468 IPC – Forgery for the purpose of cheating.[3]
– Section 471 IPC – Using as genuine a forged document, knowing or having reason to believe it to be forged.[3]
– Section 120B IPC – Criminal conspiracy, if the accused persons acted together in planning the fraud.

4. SAMPLE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT / FIR (TEXT)

To,  
The Station House Officer  
________ Police Station, Pune  

Subject: Complaint regarding cheating and use of forged documents in respect of land Gat No.145, Village Gurudham, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune.

Respected Sir,

1. I, Mr. Rohan Patil, age 35 years, residing at Kothrud, Pune, state as follows.

2. In January 2023, Accused No.1, Mr. Ajay Sharma, approached me and represented that he is the absolute owner of agricultural land bearing Gat No.145, admeasuring 1.5 Hectares, situated at Village Gurudham, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune. He showed me photocopies of a 7/12 extract and a sale deed allegedly executed in his favour in 2018 by the original owner, Mrs. Savita Joshi.[1]

3. Accused No.1, along with his brother Accused No.2, Mr. Vijay Sharma, and deed writer Accused No.3, Mr. Suresh Deshmukh, assured me that the title over the said land is clear and that there is no dispute or encumbrance. They induced me to purchase the land for a total consideration of Rs. 90,00,000.[1]

4. Believing their statements and relying on the documents shown, on 10.02.2023 I agreed to purchase the land and paid an amount of Rs. 40,00,000 (Rs. 15,00,000 in cash and Rs. 25,00,000 by bank transfer). An Agreement to Sell was executed between me and Accused No.1.[2]

5. On 15.03.2023, a registered Sale Deed in respect of the said land was executed at the Sub‑Registrar Office, Mulshi, in which Accused No.1 signed as vendor and I signed as purchaser. Accused No.3 prepared the deed and arranged witnesses and registration formalities.[2]

6. Thereafter, when I applied for mutation of my name in the revenue records, the Talathi informed me that the land continues to stand in the name of the original owner, Mrs. Savita Joshi, and that there is no record of any sale deed in favour of Accused No.1.[1]

7. I then contacted Mrs. Savita Joshi. She clearly told me that she has never sold Gat No.145 to Accused No.1 or his family and that the signatures on the so‑called 2018 sale deed are not hers.[1]

8. On further verification at the office of the Sub‑Registrar, it was revealed that the alleged 2018 sale deed is not found in the official register and that the registration number and seal on the copy shown to me are false. Thus, the purported prior sale deed and related documents are forged.[1]

9. From the above facts, it is clear that Accused Nos.1, 2, and 3, in furtherance of their common intention and criminal conspiracy, created forged documents and used them as genuine to cheat me and dishonestly obtain Rs. 40,00,000 from me.[3]

10. By their acts, the accused have committed offences punishable under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120B, and other relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code.[5][6][3]

I therefore request you to kindly:

(a) register a First Information Report against the above‑named accused persons under appropriate sections of IPC;  
(b) seize the forged documents, obtain specimen signatures, and send the documents for forensic examination; and  
(c) conduct a thorough investigation and take necessary action as per law.
